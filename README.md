KULeuvenStijl: LaTeX Beamer style for KU Leuven
===============================================

This project provides LaTeX Beamer presentation style that (roughly) conforms with the new KU Leuven 
visual identification style (KU Leuven-huisstijl).

There is an official presentation template available, alas it is only for PowerPoint. 
The official PowerPoint template will be referred to as "the upstream template".

Goals
-----

- Level 1: Beamer style that complies with the upstream template with respect to color schemes
- Level 2: Beamer style that conforms to the upstream template with respect to various components of its layout (backgrounds, logos, sectioning, decorations, ...)
- Level 3: Beamer style that extends the upstream template with Beamer fancy capabilities
- Level 4: Beamer style that offers Beamer-like look-and-feel, which diverges from the upstream template
